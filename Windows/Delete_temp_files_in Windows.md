Delete temp files - Windows
---

This is usually pretty safe and easy to-do.

**Important**: Make sure you know how to Empty the Recycle Bin.  I basically do it at the start and after every step.

- Press Windows+r
- In the box that opens, enter `%temp%`  and then click on **Run**

This should open the Windows Explorer with a bunch of files and directories with names that are a collection of letters, numbers, and symbols

- Select all of them
- **Delete**

At this point, it should start moving the selected files to the Recycle Bin.  

   **Important:**    Along the way there will probably be Administrator Access permission request, grant it, and all subsequent actions (via a checkbox).  Use the **Continue** button.    Also, there may be notifications of a particular file or directory being Open or In-use. Again select the `all subsequent` checkbox, then use the **Skip** button.

- Close the Windows Explorer window
- Empty the Recycle Bin.

Repeat the above procedure replacing `%temp%` with `temp`

Repeat the above procedure replacing `%temp%`Â with `prefetch`
